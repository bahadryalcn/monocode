/**
 * Which folders deserve a rail group, going by the folder each project sits in.
 *
 * Projects that share a parent folder are grouped under that folder's name
 * (`G:/Projects/Acme/*` becomes "Acme"). The rule is deliberately
 * conservative, because it runs on a pile of newly imported projects:
 *
 * - a parent needs at least `minMembers` of the given projects, unless the user
 *   already has a group of that name for them to join, so a lone project never
 *   gets a group of its own;
 * - drive roots and the home folder are not containers worth a group;
 * - projects the user already placed in a group are never touched or counted;
 * - parents are matched case-insensitively the way Windows paths are, so
 *   `g:\Projects` and `G:\Projects` are one folder;
 * - two different parents with the same folder name are told apart by their
 *   location rather than merged.
