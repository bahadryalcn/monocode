# Automatic corrections for unattended tasks

Goal, steward and explicitly auto-merge tasks get up to three automatic correction runs after a concrete
review failure or a check command returning a nonzero exit code. Other manual tasks keep
their existing explicit Retry behavior. Each correction uses a fresh worker session
in the existing task worktree, with the original prompt and bounded verification
feedback. The original checks and reviewer run again before delivery.
Structured open findings are sent once with their suggestions; their surrounding
review transcript is not duplicated in correction prompts. Legacy details remain available.

## Automatic integration recovery

Verified auto-merge tasks waiting in Review are reconsidered on host ticks, including
cards left by older hosts. A dirty/wrong-branch checkout or another pending merge
waits without a worker. Unchanged checkout failures have a persisted five-minute
backoff; changed branch heads or checkout state allow immediate retry. Merges into
one project are serialized. The host never stashes, resets or switches the owner's checkout.

A real merge conflict queues an integration correction in the retained task worktree.
The host merges the recorded base commit there, preserving both histories. Only
unresolved integration defects are handed to the worker; a clean base integration
goes straight to verification without a worker. Checks and review run again against
the updated base before delivery and dependent tasks start. Unresolved Git index
entries cannot be automatically staged as completed work. Integration corrections
have a separate persisted three-attempt limit and obey concurrency/daily limits.
Owner stops and unavailable acceptance checks remain stopped. A dirty task checkout
after review is retained for inspection rather than silently absorbed into recovery.

If delivery succeeds but worktree removal fails, its path and cleanup error remain
on the done task. Later drafts are retained; removal is never forced.

A required review note may explicitly specify `category: "external"` plus an
actionable suggestion naming missing device/access and the check required. If all
current required findings are external, correction stops immediately, without
claiming acceptance or releasing dependencies. Mixed reviews still repair code.
Legacy prose is never guessed to be external. Identical required findings after a
correction stop further automatic retries as unchanged; moved source line numbers
do not count as a new finding. Existing location-only duplicates are coalesced with
their review links and conservative open/unread state retained.
In the same JSON block reviewers may provide `resolvedNoteIds` for earlier required
findings they actually verified fixed, even when another issue keeps the verdict
at FAIL. Merely omitting an old finding does not resolve it; a recurring finding
reopens it. This keeps obsolete defects from hiding the current acceptance blocker.

The detail panel records up to 20 review outcomes, each with worker-reported summary,
review verdict and worker/reviewer links. Old tasks cannot reconstruct missing run
history; their latest review remains available. Stop reasons distinguish external
verification, unchanged findings and exhausted attempts. Marking a note fixed does
not remove these verification requirements.

Hosts advertising `tasks.review-recheck` support `tasks.review.recheck`. The owner
can use **Recheck review** on blocked work with an existing failed review: checks
and the reviewer run against existing work, without launching a worker. A failed
recheck stays blocked; PASS uses the normal delivery/merge gates. Retry remains the
explicit action for a new worker correction after supplying access or changing the
approach. Independent queued tasks continue; dependent tasks wait for delivery.

Correction counts are stored with the task and survive host restarts. The board
shows the attempt number and the latest finding. After three corrections, another
failure leaves the task blocked with its verification details; an explicit Retry
does not reset this allowance. Concurrency, daily usage limits and dependencies still apply.
Independent queued work can continue; dependents wait until the prerequisite is done.

Three failed reviews since the last instruction change also stop the task, even
when finding wording changes or Retry previously reset the correction counter.
Legacy tasks recover this count from their retained attempt history. External-only
findings, unchanged findings, and a failed review-only recheck stop earlier.
The next host tick gives blocked verification failures one independent AI takeover
before asking the owner for help. The fresh session keeps the assigned model,
branch and worktree, and receives the original task contract, earlier outcomes,
remaining findings and blocker as a bounded JSON handoff. It must diagnose a
different approach, complete the work and pass the original checks plus review.
Takeover only starts from Blocked; owner stops, provider failures, missing verdicts,
cancelled goals and unavailable check processes are not automatically retried.
Concurrency, dependencies and daily budgets also gate takeover. Its durable marker
survives restarts; it cannot recursively hand off or start another correction loop.

If takeover still fails, the task shows **Needs input / Waiting for your
instructions** and **Update instructions** instead of Retry/Recheck. The recovery
agent is asked to leave one concrete request naming the missing resource or input.
The owner can change the description to explain a new approach, provide missing
evidence/access, or revise the requirement.
Renaming, whitespace edits, host restarts and moving through To do cannot bypass
the gate. Saving new instructions resets the budget without starting work; the
owner can then Retry or Recheck. Existing worktrees, findings and history remain.

Worker/runtime failures, owner stops, reviewer failures or missing verdicts, and
check timeouts or commands that cannot start remain blocked. Reviews distinguish
implementation defects from unavailable device/release/service acceptance checks,
while still requiring any evidence explicitly requested by the task.

For existing running or blocked goals, legacy review failures can recover once.
Recovery requires a matching successful reviewer session and its explicit FAIL
verdict. Cancelled goals, owner-stopped tasks, missing sessions and exhausted
correction attempts are not revived. Installing this host change is required for
the policy to affect tasks on that machine.

## Structured task briefs

New goal plans use a `monocode.task.v1` brief with `objective`, `deliverables`,
`acceptance`, `constraints` and `verification`. The host stores the JSON as prompt
text for compatibility and sends workers/reviewers a task-contract envelope.
Cards display the objective; details render the brief as readable sections.
Legacy plain-text instructions remain intact. Unknown JSON fields are never
silently discarded. Hosts advertise automatic takeover with `tasks.blocked-takeover`;
the UI does not promise it for older hosts.

## Persistent review notes

Reviewers can return a `reviewNotes` JSON array before their verdict. Each entry
contains a `finding`, optional `suggestion`, and `kind` (`finding` or `suggestion`).
The host stores notes on the task before retrying it. Legacy FAIL reviews become
a summary note with their supporting review text when that session is available;
the latest trusted automatic-correction summary can also be retained without a
session. Missing or failed reviewer evidence is not invented as a code finding.

Cards and the board show unread counts. The detail panel offers Mark as read,
Mark fixed, Reopen note, and links to source review sessions. Read updates name
the displayed note IDs, leaving newer findings unread. These states live on the
host and survive retries, refreshes and host restarts. Older hosts remain usable
without note controls; updated hosts advertise `tasks.notes`.

Repeated findings with matching wording (ignoring case and whitespace) retain
their ID and source-session history. Reviewers are asked to reuse earlier wording.
A fixed finding that returns is reopened and unread. Open notes are included in
worker/reviewer prompts; optional suggestions are labelled as optional. PASS
closes existing required findings while retaining optional suggestions. Changing
a note's state never marks a task done, merges a branch or bypasses verification.
